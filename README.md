---

## 📘 Overview
This project analyzes and evaluates **ten financial assets**, including **nine publicly traded football clubs** and **one cryptocurrency (Solana)**, over the period from **December 2023 to November 2024**.  
It was developed as part of the **Master 1 – Econometrics and Statistics (Applied Econometrics)** program.

**Objectives**
- Examine return and volatility behavior of football club equities versus cryptocurrency  
- Assess performance using multiple **risk-adjusted indicators** (Sharpe, Jensen, Treynor, Sortino, Roy, Information ratio)  
- Apply **Modern Portfolio Theory** to construct **efficient portfolios** (minimum variance and tangency)  
- Visualize and interpret correlations, covariances, and efficient frontiers  

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Automated data retrieval from **Yahoo Finance**  
- Calculation of **daily returns, volatilities, and descriptive statistics**  
- Visualization of **price and return dynamics** per asset  
- Computation of **variance–covariance and correlation matrices**  
- Implementation of **risk–return optimization** (minimum variance and tangent portfolios)  
- Graphical representation of the **efficient frontier**

## 📚 Usage Example

```r
# Load data from Yahoo Finance
tickers <- c("JUVE.MI", "SSL.MI", "XXT.SG", "CCP.L", "BVB.MU",
             "SCP.LS", "AAB.CO", "GSRAY.IS", "AJAX.AS", "SOL-USD")
data <- map(tickers, function(i) tq_get(i, from = "2023-12-01", to = "2024-11-30"))

# Compute returns
base <- bind_rows(data) |>
  group_by(symbol) |>
  mutate(return = close / lag(close) - 1)

# Efficient frontier plot
ggplot(Actifs3bis, aes(x = Sdp, y = Ep)) +
  geom_point() + labs(title = "Efficient Frontier")
```

## 📊 Results
The analysis reveals:
- **Solana (SOL-USD)** exhibits extremely high volatility and kurtosis, confirming its speculative nature.  
- **Football clubs** show **moderate volatility** and similar sectoral correlations.  
- **Minimum variance portfolio** offers a lower risk (σ = 0.01148) and slightly higher expected return than the tangent portfolio.  
- **Diversification** significantly improves efficiency, confirming the theoretical expectations of **Markowitz’s Modern Portfolio Theory**.
